This repository contains:
- =roster-to-photos.sh=: A script that takes the PDF obtained from the roster
  tab in CampusConnect and extracts as PNG the photo of each student.  The
  database is stored in a CSV file that lists the UID/Name/PNG file for each
  student.
- =attendance.tex=: A LuaLaTeX file that parses the resulting CSV (therein
  =roster.csv=) and lay the students out in an attendance sheet.  *This must be
  processed with LuaLaTeX*

Example usage:
#+begin_example
$ ./roster-to-pngs.sh DU_SRC_CLSROS.pdf roster.csv
running pdfimages...
processing student #27. all done.
$ latexmk -lualatex attendance.tex
#+end_example
